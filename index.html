        This is a website that I created to show my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        This was imagined, setup, and created from the ground up.  The photos, background,
        coloring, layout, and stylesheets were made to work together in this site.  From
        this page you can move to how to make your own website - basics of HTML and CSS.
        You can also move to different Javascript examples plus games that are added here
        and that can be added to your own created site.
